# MC2

machine learning program that created with the intention to learn and experience machine learning math.

# Data
The machine's training algorithem support three data optains
1. data base (csv file)
2. play against bot (doesn't need any data base)
3. play against imself (beta)

# Training
The trainig algorithm the program is using called "grid train" and its a temporary algorithm that was created to test and learn neural networks.
Because the grid train algorithm take a lot of processing power to train the machin for now I recomand to test this algorithm in relatively easy things to learn like tic-tac-toe for example.

# Data saveing 
The program have nerual network storge format that can be used on any machine learning object by the command exportModel(). you can also use the command importModel() to set your model to be as model you exported previously.

# Runner class
The runner class was created to simplify the training process.
